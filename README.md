# Research Topic: Genetic Algoritm make a cube go trough a level with obsticals
## Discription
For my project I decided to make a genetic algoritm 
In this research project, we explore the application of genetic algorithms for guiding a cube through a level with obstacles. 
The study investigates the effectiveness of evolutionary strategies in optimizing the cube's navigation.
Unfortunately i wasn't able to make it work in time.

## What is a Genetic Algorthm?
A Genetic Algorithm is a type of optimization algorithm inspired by the process of natural selection and evolution. 
It is commonly used to find approximate solutions to optimization and search problems.

# Genetic Algorthm Implementation
### Initialization:
A population of potential solutions (individuals) is randomly generated to represent the initial set of candidate solutions to a given problem.

### CalculateFitness:
Each individual in the population is evaluated against a predefined fitness function that quantifies how well the solution solves the problem.
The fitness function guides the selection process by assigning a numerical value to each individual based on its performance.

### Selection:
Individuals are selected from the population based on their fitness scores. Those with higher fitness scores are more likely to be selected. 

### Crossover:
Crossover is a genetic operator in genetic algorithms where genetic material from two parent individuals is combined to create new offspring individuals.

### Mutation:
Mutation is a genetic operator in genetic algorithms that introduces random changes to the genetic material of individuals. 
This helps explore new areas of the solution space and prevents the algorithm from getting stuck in local optima.

### SimulateGame
 The simulation models the individual's behavior over a series of time steps, and the function returns a fitness value based on the individual's performance during the simulation.
